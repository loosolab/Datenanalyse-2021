# Work Package 5 - Motif Discovery

## Introduction

## Setup and Installation
To use this work package it is important that you have three further tools installed:
* [TOBIAS](https://github.com/loosolab/TOBIAS)
* [motif discovery pipeline](https://github.com/loosolab/motif-discovery-pipeline)
* [GSEA](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html)

Please follow the installation instructions of those projects and make sure you have the according conda environments installed. It is neccecary that the TOBIAS environment is called "TOBIAS_ENV". 
Furthermore, you need an environment for snakemake wich should also be called "snakemake". To use the GSEA tool you have to follow the instructions of the "Running GSEA from the Command Line" part.

Additionally 
To install the WP5-Package please ... # TODO
--> TODO: environment with Plotly <br>
To use the GSEA you have to use one of the supported [data formats](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMT:_Gene_Matrix_Transposed_file_format_.28.2A.gmt.29). With the WP5-Package the *.gmt format can be generated automatically.


## Usage
This work package consists of several scripts (found in the *scripts* directory) which can also be concatenated to a pipeline. For more detailed information please refer to the [WP5-Wiki](https://github.com/loosolab/Datenanalyse-2021/wiki/WP5).

The single steps of the pipeline are:
1. [create_folders.sh](#1-create-folders)
2. [generate configs](#2-generate-configs)

    a) generate_configs.sh
        
    b) generate_configs_with_annotation.sh
    
3. [run_pipeline.sh](#3-run-pipeline)
4. [check_logs.sh](#4-check-logs) (optional)
5. [renameAllMotifs.sh](#5-rename-motifs)
6. [cluster_all.sh](#6-cluster-all)
7. [Eval_Motif_similarity.py](#7-evaluate-motif-similarity)

Steps 1-5 are contain the actual motif-discovery-pipeline run, aswell as the needed pre- and postprocessing.
Steps 6 and 7 are for the analysis of similarities between the found motifs in different pipeline runs. 
In case of the given ATAC-Seq data the motif discovery pipelin is ran for each celltype of each tissue given.

Before Starting the pipeline it is important to adjust the config file (TODO).


### 1. Create folders
### 2. Generate configs
The script *generate_configs.sh* is called as follows:

```
./generate_configs.sh <DIRECTORY-WP3-OUTPUT>
```
The parameter `<DIRECTORY-WP3-OUTPUT>` should contain the path to the output of work package 3. 
TODO EXAMPLE

### 3. Run pipeline
The script *run_pipeline.sh* is called as follows:

```
./run_pipeline.sh <CONFIG-DIRECTORY>
```
The parameter `<CONFIG-DIRECTORY>` should contain the path to the directory where the generated configs (of step 2) are stored.
The script will start the motif discovery pipeline for all configs found in the given directory. 
> **Attention**: If you are working via an ssh connection make sure to start this script in a screen, as it might take a while.

### 4. Check logs
### 5. Rename motifs
This script is neccesary, as the motif discovery pipeline will give the motif dummy names. 
As those might appear in several runs, it is important for further analysis to rename the motifs in a unique manner.
This will be done automatically by this script for the MEME file generated by the motif discovery pipeline.

The script can be called as follows:

```
./renameAllMotifs.sh <motif-discovery-runs-directory>
```
The parameter `<motif-discovery-runs-directory>` should contain the path to the *runs* directory,
in which all motif discovery runs are stored.

### 6. Cluster all
To establish if any of the found motifs appear in different tissues or celltypes in a similar way, the scripts *cluster_all.sh* and 
*eval_Motif_similarity.py* are provided. 
The idea is to cluster all found motifs with a relatively low threshold (=0.3) using TOBIAS. All clusters found will then be treated as the same motif.
For each cluster a consensus sequence is calculated, and may be used for further analysis. Though, manual inspection is advised before using the consensus sequence.

To perform the clustering, the script is called follows:
```
./cluster_all.sh <motif-discovery-runs-directory> <TODO> 
```
The parameter `<motif-discovery-runs-directory>` should contain the path to the *runs* directory,
in which all motif discovery runs are stored.
