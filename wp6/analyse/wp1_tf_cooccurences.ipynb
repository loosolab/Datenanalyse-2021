    "### Outline of this notebook:\n",
    "    1. Constants, Path and Interface Definitions \n",
    "    2. Market Basket analysis with tf-comb, for all cluster/celltypes of a tissue\n",
    "    3. Differential analysis with all market basket analysis (CombObj ´s) of step 2 for the clusters/celltypes of a single tissue. (One DiffCombObj for each tissue)\n",
    "    4. Analysis for biological questions \n",
    "    \n",
    "The aim is to find transcription-factor-co-occurences for cluster/celltypes of human tissues with the help of the python-library tf-comb (https://github.com/loosolab/TF-COMB). For the data of WP1. The data basis comes from the \"cell atlas of chromatin accessibility across 25 adult human tissues\"(https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.431699) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Biological question, that we want to answer with this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find Transcriptionfactor-co-occurences, which only occure in one (or more) \"cluster/celltypes of a tissue\".\n",
    "    Maybe we can identify a cluster through this co-occurences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use this notbook:**\n",
    "1. Please adapted the paths in Constants, Path and interface defintions for your approach\n",
    "2. Please make sure you have installed the kernel as it is described in the ReadMe\n",
    "3. Check if the WP3 Data structure is correctly provided (ReadMe).\n",
    "    - Has all tissues as a folder in it: ../OUPTPUT_FOLDER/\n",
    "    - You find the data (open cromatin regions per cluster .bed-files) e.g ../OUPTPUT_FOLDER/<tissue>/WP6/*cluster_x.bed\n",
    "4. Execute each notebook window from top to bottom one after another."
